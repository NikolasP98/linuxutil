**Linutil** is a distro-agnostic toolbox designed to simplify everyday Linux tasks. It helps you set up applications and optimize your system for specific use cases. The utility is actively developed in Rust ü¶Ä, providing performance and reliability.

> [!NOTE]
> Since the project is still in active development, you may encounter some issues. Please consider [submitting feedback](https://github.com/NikolasP98/linuxutil/issues) if you do.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

Linutil is also available as a package in various repositories:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/linutil.svg)](https://repology.org/project/linutil/versions)

<details>
  <summary>Arch Linux</summary>

Linutil can be installed on [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) with three different [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org) packages:

- `linutil` - Stable release compiled from source
- `linutil-bin` - Stable release pre-compiled
- `linutil-git` - Compiled from the last commit (not recommended)

by running:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/<package>.git
cd <package>
makepkg -si
```

Replace `<package>` with your preferred package.

If you use [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay), [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru) or any other [AUR Helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers), it's even simpler:

```bash
paru -S linutil
```

Replace `paru` with your preferred helper and `linutil` with your preferred package.

<details>
  <summary>OpenSUSE</summary>
  
Linutil can be installed on OpenSUSE with:
```bash
sudo zypper install linutil
```

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Cargo</summary>

Linutil can be installed via [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo) with:

```bash
cargo install linutil_tui
```

Note that crates installed using `cargo install` require manual updating with `cargo install --force` (update functionality is included in LinUtil)

## Configuration

Linutil supports configuration through a TOML config file. Path to the file can be specified with `--config` (or `-c`).

Available options:
- `auto_execute` - A list of commands to execute automatically (can be combined with `--skip-confirmation`)
- `skip_confirmation` - Boolean ( Equal to `--skip-confirmation`)
- `size_bypass` - Boolean ( Equal to `--size-bypass` )

Example config:
```toml
# example_config.toml

auto_execute = [
    "Fastfetch",
    "Alacritty",
    "Kitty"
]

skip_confirmation = true
size_bypass = true
```

```bash
linutil --config /path/to/example_config.toml
```

### Adding New Modules and Folders

To add new functionality to Linutil:

1. **Adding Shell Scripts**: Place new shell scripts in the appropriate subdirectory under `core/tabs/`. For example:
   - Application setup scripts: `core/tabs/applications-setup/`
   - System setup scripts: `core/tabs/system-setup/`
   - Utility scripts: `core/tabs/utilities/`

2. **Creating New Categories**: To add a new category of tools:
   - Create a new subdirectory under `core/tabs/`
   - Add a `tab_data.toml` file to define the category structure
   - Follow the existing pattern of other categories

3. **Configuration**: Update the `tab_data.toml` files to include your new scripts:
   ```toml
   [[data]]
   name = "Your Script Name"
   script = "your-script.sh"
   description = "Description of what your script does"
   ```

4. **Testing**: Always test your scripts on different distributions before submitting
